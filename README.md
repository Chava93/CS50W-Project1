# Project 1

This project builds up a book review web application named "Libros".

The key functionalities are:
1. Register a new user.
2. Log in users.
3. Allow users to look for books given the isbns, title or author and if Found give a rating and leave comments.
4. Allow users to query book information via API

For this it was necessary to create the following tables:
1. Users
2. Books
3. Reviews

This table exists in Postgres in a Heroku project.

Finally it was also necessary to implement API connectivity to GoodReads API service.
